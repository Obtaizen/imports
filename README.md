Import Vehicles

## For Custom Car Sounds (For Cars that need them)

* Drag [car-sounds] into your `resources` folder
* Ensure [car-sounds] in your Server CFG
* Make sure you add the vehicles to your core (if using QBCore) qb-core/shared/vehicles.lua
I made a .txt with the snippet of cars to make it easier so you can copy + paste them into your vehicles.lua

## Optional Vehicles

* These vehicles are replaces of current GTA Online / Story Vehicles. If these can be converted into add-ons and you would like to contribute, make a PR and it will be greatly appreciated!

* Phantom was placed into a Zip File given the size of the assets.

### A bunch of vehicles that NoPixel use.

### Link to where I got the vehicles from https://pastebin.com/jsvw46cn this includes each GTA 5 Mods link
